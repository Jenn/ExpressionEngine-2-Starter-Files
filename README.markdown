ExpressionEngine2 Starter Files
================================

What are EE Starter Files?
---------------------------

A reusable set of folders, files and code snippets used to being a project built in ExpressionEngine2. In EE1, you could save templates as flat files, but not the other way around. In EE2, you can do both and create templates from your files. This allows us to use these files to get a jumpstart on EE development.


How do I get started?
---------------------

The "c" and "j" folder go into the web root (to keep the paths correct) and the default.site folder goes into your template directory. 
Load up your control panel to give it a nice forced refresh and it will then recognize your new templates!
